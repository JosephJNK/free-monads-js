This project is an attempt to build the architecture advocated in John A Degoes' "A Modern Architecture for FP" (found at http://degoes.net/articles/modern-fp/ ) in JavaScript. This repository contains several ports of code from this article into JS. There are likely additional ways in which this port may be performed, so if you don't like any of the examples in this repository, that should not indicate that a nice port isn't possible. Also this isn't meant to advocate this architecture for JS projects; I just wanted to see what it might look like.
