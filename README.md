# Free-monads-js

This is a work in progress, and needs code cleanup and unit tests. Using this project at this stage is not recommended.

Inspired by ["A Modern Architecture for FP"](http://degoes.net/articles/modern-fp/), ["Compositional Application Architecture with Reasonably Priced Monads"](http://functionaltalks.org/2014/11/23/runar-oli-bjarnason-free-monad/) and ["Data types a la Carte"](https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~swier004/Publications/DataTypesALaCarte.pdf), this project is intended to allow developers to architect JS applications compositionally, from well-defined algebras and separate, composable interpreters. It aims to abstract away any notion of the types and theory behind free monads, while providing a correct implementation of their semantics.
