This project is an attempt to build the architecture advocated in John A Degoes' "A Modern Architecture for FP" (found at http://degoes.net/articles/modern-fp/ ) in JavaScript. There are likely other ways to acheive this port than I have attempted here, so if you don't like my version of the code, that doesn't necessarily mean that the architecture isn't tenable for JavaScript. Also this isn't (currently) an attempt to advocate for this architecture for JS/node applications, but is an investigation into what that might look like.

This is a work in progress.
